Hey! I am Hubert and this is my blog. It is intended as a collection of (mainly ML-related) ideas and thoughts that I feel do not fit anywhere else. There are many such topics in my backlog - most of which are half-baked, unfinished ideas that never made it into a paper during my PhD studies (which I also did not finish). And since these ideas still meander around in my head, mainly during the night, stealing my sleep, I try to tame them by writing about them and doing the occasional experiment. Between work and family there is not much time for that, so the updates will likely be sparse.

Anyway, thanks for browsing through this graveyard of ambitions! :)
